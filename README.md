# Soccer_team_roster
Python program: CRUD operation on the players dictionary

1) How this program works?
    This program will ask an user to choose an option, then, based on that option it will call a specific function, for example - if an user selects option 'a' then to add a player in the players dictionary the program will call the addPlayer() function and will ask the user to insert the jersey number and the rating of the player he wants to add. 
While viewing an output of the player's jersey and rating info, it will sort the records in the players dictionary.
2) All necessary info about the program is given in comment sections, please go through them.
3) The "outputRoster()" function is called in each function to show an overview of the players dictionary after the operation of each functions is complete. This is to show you what impact that function fells on the players dictionary.
